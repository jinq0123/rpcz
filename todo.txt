* Replace std::map with boost::unordered_map.
  
* One-way request. 
  If async request has no callback, the request becomes an one-way request.
  No event_id. No response.

* Void request, like:
    service SearchService {
      rpc SearchGold(VoidRequest) returns(SearchResponse);
    }

    SearchResponse resp = searchStub.SearchGold();

* Use TBB concurrent queue instead of ZMQ inproc queue.
